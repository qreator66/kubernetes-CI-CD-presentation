## Abstract: 
The path we walked on took us closer to #Docker and #Kubernetes. In previous meetings we discovered how to create and publish an image containing our application and how this can be execute as a #Container within a Pod, we have seen how to expose it through services and ingress controllers, how to manage its security and all the various settings that a Kubernetes cluster provides us to ensure their availability and access to resources such as storage and other services.  
A Kubernetes cluster does not exist per se but is a platform on which to run our software solutions. With this sixth appointment we will therefore try to talk about the possible approaches about the application release and update activities. We will compare the options offered by #Kubectl, #Kustomize, #Helm and #Terraform and we will see how to integrate all this in CI \ CD tools using #Azure #DevOps Services in order to view some examples.
